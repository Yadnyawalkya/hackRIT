A month ago, I found Privilege Escalation vulnerability in my college's website which allow user to access other's images without special privileges. Here I have taken advantage of this and wrote hackRIT exploit. 

hackRIT is simple python script which automates Wget commands and download photos of other graduates from college directory. This is kinda a (GET_SQLinjection + PE) stuff. 

##Package Requirement 
Python 2.7+ 
(Don't Worry ! Generally all Linux platforms runs with inbuild python packages)

##Process to Run  
Just simple,
In command line type
```
python hackRIT.py
```
##Discrimination 
This was a fun project and my only intension was to pointing out bugs in website. I am not violating any right of Institution intentionally.
